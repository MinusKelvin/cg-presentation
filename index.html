				<div id="coordinates"></div>
				<div class="leaf-left shown" id="s1t1">
					Your screen is a grid of pixels, and so all computer graphics must be put of a grid of pixels somehow.
					<br><br>The screen is basically a coordinate system, and so locations are just a pair of coordinates.
				</div>
				<div class="leaf-right hidden" id="s1t2">
					Using whole-number coordinates, points fall exactly on pixels' centers and everything is really easy.
					<br><br>Drawing lines is simple, you just start at the beginning of the line and step along it until you reach the end of the line.
				</div>
				<div class="leaf-left hidden" id="s1t3">
					Drawing filled shapes, always triangles, is a little bit harder, but is still relatively simple to do quickly and efficently.
					<br><br>The only filled shapes we draw are triangles because all other shapes can be made (or approximated) with triangles, and it simplifies things a ton.
				</div>
				<div class="leaf-right hidden" id="s1t4">
					We can rotate these around the center of the screen with a little bit of math and...<br>Uh oh! That rotation is really choppy and not very smooth. Rather ugly.
					<br><br>The problem here is that since we're using whole number coordinates, we're losing information about the exact location of the triangle's corners.
				</div>
				<div class="leaf-left hidden" id="s1t5">
					Ah! Much better. By changing our coordinate system from using whole numbers to using decimals, we can target parts of pixels instead of just the centers of them.
					<br><br>This makes drawing stuff more complicated, but looks so much nicer.
				</div>
				<div class="leaf-right hidden" id="s1t6">
					One color is kinda boring. Here's 3 colors!
					<br><br>We colored one point of the triangle <span style="color:red;">red</span>, another <span style="color:green;">green</span>,
					and the last <span style="color:blue;">blue</span>. The colors are smoothly shifted from one to another inside the triangle.

					Now that we know how graphics end up on the screen, it's time for something more interesting: 3D
					<br><br>This surface is generated from several sine waves based on each points' position and time. It's made of 20,000 triangles.
				</div>
				<div class="leaf-right hidden" id="s2t2">
					You can see the current time value at the top. It's not changing, so the surface is not changing.
					<br><br><span id="s2t3" class="bit hidden">Now that time is changing, the surface is changing. You can use the above slider to change the timescale.</span>
				</div>
				<div class="leaf-left hidden" id="s2t4">
					As the surface changes, the lighting on the surface also changes. Lighting is quite interesting.
					<br><br>It requires two things at a minimum: a light direction, and a surface normal.
				</div>
				<div class="leaf-right hidden" id="s2t5">
					A surface normal is the direction that sticks straight of out a surface, or in other words the direction at a right angle to a surface.
					<br><br>I'm showing those as blue lines here.
				</div>
				<div class="leaf-left hidden" id="s2t6">
					The light direction is the direction from the light source, which in this case is the same for every point to make it look like sunlight.
					<br><br>You can use the slider at the bottom to change the light's direction.
				</div>
				<div class="leaf-right hidden" id="s2t7">
					Once we have the surface normal and the light direction, we can easily calculate how bright the surface should be.
					<br><br>Oh, and all that lighting stuff is run per-pixel, which works out to your computer being really, really fast.
